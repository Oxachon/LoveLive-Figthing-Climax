LoveLive Figthing Climax
===================

A fighting game I started some years ago. I also forgot about the artist's name, I'm sorry! If I happen to remember about it, I'll update this readme.md.

At this date (04/2016), there's only a bugged character selector, haha! I plan on finishing the fighting game someday, but it's not planned right now. I also need to refactor the code, since it's a real pain to the eye to watch! Feel free to contribute!
